Classification

2X4Full: Part of the 120 Model Run and shows validation accuracy of all the possible combination of hyperparamters. Heatmap gives visualization and is exponential to highlight the top few
120RunAll: Same as 2X4, although graphed in 3D to remove one dimension. Color represents accuracy.
ClassifyDistilledAcc: Accuracy for Classify Distilled Model, part of model choosing
classifyDistilledLoss: Loss for Classify Distilled Model, part of model choosing
t5ModelAcc: Accuracy for t5 Model, part of model choosing
t5ModelLoss: Loss for t5 Model, part of model choosing
Final Accuarcy Graph: Accuracy for final classification model used in chrome extension
Final Loss Graph: Loss for final classification model used in chrome extension

Generation

Detox3Epoch: First Model trained with 3 Epochs
Detox5Epoch: Model trained with 5 Epochs (Currently used in Chrome Extension)
